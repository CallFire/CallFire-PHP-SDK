## Installation

The preferred method of installing this library is through the
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) dependency management tool.

Please refer to the [Composer intro](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
if you are unfamiliar with this tool.

Note: Api client methods hints with examples can be generated.
Each method hint also includes code sample how to configure api request and what parameters are available. 
You'll be able to use that hints from ide for easier coding of your integration.
To do that please run command:
`php src/CallFire/CodeHint/CodeHintsGenerator.php generateCodeHints swaggerJsonUrl`
`swaggerJsonUrl` last parameter can be skipped - default path (https://www.callfire.com/v2/api-docs/swagger.json) 
will be used for getting swagger json.
