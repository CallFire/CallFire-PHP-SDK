Getting Started
===============

The CallFire API provides a fairly robust interface by which to control
most every bit of functionality available through the regular web interface,
plus some controls which are not otherwise accessible.

This library provides a set of PHP classes to interface with the
[CallFire API](http://www.callfire.com/api-documentation). Please refer to the
[API documentation](http://www.callfire.com/api-documentation) for information
on finding your API credentials.

If you are unable to utilize the Composer dependency management tool, please
refer to [Getting Started Without Composer](getting-started/01.without-composer.md).

There are two separate, but largely equivalent endpoints by which you can
access the CallFire API. These are the REST and SOAP APIs. Due to limitations
in the PHP SOAP extension, you should largely aim to use the REST API,
especially when interacting with the Broadcast services.

Both the SOAP and REST APIs share a common set of resources that they return,
and share a set of operation "interfaces", they are invoked very differently.
The benefit of these commonalities is that when you find an issue with one
API endpoint, you can conceivably fall back in that instance to the other endpoint
without too much difficulty.

## The REST API

The REST API is the primary API endpoint going forward, having a design
which aims to make the structure of API requests far more intuitive and
stable. While it has its own idiosyncracies, they are easily overcome.

### Very basic example
This example demonstrates how to instantiate the REST API client, create
a request object, invoke a request, and then parse the response into
an easily-consumable form.  
```php
<?php
use CallFire\Api\Rest\Request;
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = CallFire\Api\Client::Rest("<api-login>", "<api-password>", "Broadcast");

$request = new Request\QueryBroadcasts;
$response = $client->QueryBroadcasts($request);

$broadcasts = $client::response($response);

foreach($broadcasts as $broadcast) {
    var_dump($broadcast);
}
```

Though this code is fairly intuitive, there are a few clarifications that
might be necessary.

First, each request is codified into a request object
(a sort of "criteria object"). Any parameters in the request object
which are left null will not be specified to the API. Not all
operations require a request object, and some operations require
additional parameters before the request object (e.g. a resource identifier).
This cleanly separates *required* parameters from optional/context-dependent
parameters, to avoid confusion.

The return value from any given operation method is the unmodified response
body of the API request. This allows you to process the response in other ways,
should you need to bypass this library's response parsing.

### Responses

The `$client::response()` method is in fact a static method call to
`CallFire\Api\Rest\AbstractClient::response()`, which intuits the type of the
response and instantiates, and populates, an appropriate response object.

For methods which are returning lists of resources (e.g. QueryBroadcasts),
this is a `CallFire\Api\Rest\Response\ResourceList` object. This object
is an iterable set of resources (ordinarily all of the same type), such as
`CallFire\Common\Resource\Broadcast` objects.

If an operation is returning one of a resource, instead of several, then
it will instead be parsed into a `CallFire\Api\Rest\Response\Resource` object,
upon which you can then call the `getResource()` method to obtain the actual
resource.

It is also possible that an operation can return "exception" type responses,
or nothing at all. Be sure to check the type of response that you are receiving,
to ensure that it's what you expect.
