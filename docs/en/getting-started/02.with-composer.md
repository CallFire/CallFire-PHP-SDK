Getting Started With Composer
=============================

If you are able to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) then using the
CallFire SDK is as simple as adding the following lines to your composer.json
configuration file.

```json
{
    'require' : {
        'callfire/php-sdk': 'dev-master'
    }
}
```

Then running running `composer install` will copy the SDK into the vendor
directory
